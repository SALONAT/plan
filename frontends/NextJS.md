# Next.js 14.3 Development Plan using `src/app` Structure

## Stage 1: Project Setup

1. **Initialize Project**
   - Run `npx create-next-app@latest` to set up a Next.js project.
   - Use `src` directory structure by setting up `/src/app` as the main directory for pages.
2. **Configure TypeScript (if needed)**

   - Install TypeScript: `npm install --save-dev typescript @types/react`.
   - Add `tsconfig.json` for TypeScript configuration.

3. **Set Up ESLint and Prettier**

   - Install ESLint and Prettier for consistent code formatting.
   - Configure `.eslintrc.json` and `.prettierrc` for project-specific rules.

4. **Folder Structure in `src/app`**
   - `src/app`: Main routing and page components.
   - `src/components`: Shared components across the app.
   - `src/styles`: Global and module-specific styles.
   - `src/hooks`: Custom hooks for reusable logic.
   - `src/utils`: Utility functions.
   - `src/services`: API services and helper functions.
   - `src/context`: Context providers for global state.

---

## Stage 2: Routing and Layouts

1. **Implement Base Layouts**

   - Create a root layout in `src/app/layout.tsx` to define a consistent layout across all pages.
   - Use nested layouts for specific sections like `/dashboard` or `/account` for component reuse and easier navigation.

2. **Set Up Routing**

   - Use the new file-based routing in `src/app`.
   - Define primary routes in `src/app/page.tsx` and sub-routes in folders (e.g., `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`).

3. **Integrate Link Navigation**
   - Use Next.js `<Link />` components for client-side navigation.
   - Create a navigation bar if applicable and integrate links for major sections.

---

## Stage 3: Authentication and Authorization

1. **Set Up Authentication (NextAuth or Custom)**

   - Install NextAuth if using it for OAuth or credential-based authentication.
   - Create authentication routes and pages in `src/app/auth` (e.g., `signin.tsx`, `signup.tsx`).

2. **Authorization and Protected Routes**
   - Add a middleware to restrict access to specific routes for authenticated users.
   - Use React Context or a provider component to manage and access user authentication state across the app.

---

## Stage 4: Data Fetching and API Integration

1. **REST API **

   - Configure Axios, clients in `src/services` for API calls.
   - Set up functions in `src/services` to fetch and mutate data for components.

2. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG)**

   - Determine which pages need SSR or SSG (e.g., use SSR for dynamic content, SSG for static pages).
   - Implement `getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps` in relevant components.

3. **API Routes in Next.js**
   - Create custom API routes in `src/app/api` if necessary for data processing within the app.

---

## Stage 5: Component Development

1. **Design Reusable Components**

   - Start with reusable components (e.g., `Button`, `Input`, `Card`) in `src/components`.
   - Ensure they are customizable with props and CSS modules.

2. **Develop Feature-Specific Components**

   - Build components specific to each route or feature, organizing by feature folder if it aids organization.

3. **Styling Components**
   - Use CSS modules, Tailwind CSS, or styled-components for styling based on project needs.
   - Implement global styles in `src/styles/globals.css`.

---

## Stage 6: State Management and Context

1. **Define Context Providers**

   - Use Context API for global states like authentication, user data, or theme settings.
   - Create providers in `src/context` and wrap main layouts in these providers.

2. **Implement Local State in Components**
   - Use `useState`, `useReducer`, or custom hooks for component-specific state management.
   - Organize custom hooks in `src/hooks` if multiple components need similar logic.

---

## Stage 7: Testing and Debugging

1. **Unit Testing with Jest and React Testing Library**

   - Install Jest and React Testing Library for unit tests on components and utilities.
   - Write tests in `__tests__` folders near the components they cover.

2. **Integration Testing**

   - Create tests for user flows, ensuring components interact as expected.

3. **Debugging Tools**
   - Use Next.js dev tools and logging for debugging.
   - Configure breakpoints in VSCode or Chrome DevTools for step-by-step debugging.

---

## Stage 8: Performance Optimization and SEO

1. **Optimize Images and Fonts**

   - Use Next.js `<Image />` component for optimized images.
   - Use Google Fonts or self-hosted fonts with `next/font`.

2. **SEO and Meta Tags**

   - Add `<Head />` elements for meta tags, descriptions, and page-specific SEO.
   - Generate an `sitemap.xml` file if applicable.

3. **Code Splitting and Lazy Loading**
   - Use dynamic imports with Next.js to load components as needed.

---

## Stage 9: Deployment and Monitoring

1. **Build and Deploy**

   - Build the app using `next build`.
   - Deploy on Vercel, AWS, or a preferred platform.

2. **Set Up Environment Variables**

   - Use environment-specific `.env` files and Next.js environment variables for secure API keys and configurations.

3. **Monitoring and Analytics**
   - Integrate Google Analytics or similar tools to track user interactions and monitor performance.

---

This plan provides a clear path from initial setup to deployment, ensuring that each part of the **Next.js 14.3** app is organized, efficient, and scalable.
